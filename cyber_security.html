        <h1 class="course-title">Learn Cyber Security</h1>
        <p class="course-description">Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. With the increasing reliance on digital technologies, organizations must safeguard their sensitive information from hackers, malware, and other security breaches. Cybersecurity encompasses various techniques, including encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.</p>
        <p class="course-description">One of the critical aspects of cybersecurity is ethical hacking, where professionals identify vulnerabilities in systems before malicious attackers exploit them. This involves penetration testing, social engineering, and security assessments to strengthen defenses. Learning ethical hacking techniques helps individuals understand how cybercriminals operate, allowing them to develop effective countermeasures.</p>
        <p class="course-description">Another essential component of cybersecurity is digital forensics, which involves investigating cybercrimes and gathering electronic evidence. Cyber forensic experts analyze data breaches, recover lost information, and trace attackers through digital footprints. This field plays a vital role in law enforcement, corporate security, and national defense, ensuring justice and accountability in the digital world.</p>
        <p class="course-description">As cyber threats continue to evolve, businesses and governments invest heavily in cybersecurity strategies. Professionals in this field must stay updated with the latest trends, such as AI-driven security solutions, cloud security, and blockchain-based authentication. A career in cybersecurity offers vast opportunities, from network security analysts to security consultants, making it a crucial and rewarding domain in today's digital landscape.</p>
