        <h1 class="course-title">Learn Artificial Intelligence</h1>
        <p class="course-description">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. AI systems use algorithms, data, and computational power to make intelligent decisions without human intervention. From virtual assistants to self-driving cars, AI is revolutionizing industries and shaping the future of technology.</p>
        <p class="course-description">AI is broadly categorized into Narrow AI and General AI. Narrow AI is designed for specific tasks, such as recommendation systems and speech recognition, whereas General AI aims to replicate human-like cognitive abilities across various domains. AI applications include Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, and expert systems.</p>
        <p class="course-description">Machine Learning and Deep Learning are key subsets of AI, enabling systems to learn patterns from data and improve over time. Deep learning, powered by neural networks, has significantly advanced fields such as image recognition, language translation, and autonomous systems. AI development involves using frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenAIâ€™s GPT models.</p>
        <p class="course-description">As AI continues to evolve, ethical considerations, bias in algorithms, and responsible AI development have become critical areas of focus. Businesses are leveraging AI for automation, predictive analytics, and decision-making, creating a growing demand for AI professionals. With advancements in AI-driven automation, the future holds immense potential for innovation across multiple sectors.</p>
