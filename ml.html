        <h1 class="course-title">Learn Machine Learning</h1>
        <p class="course-description">Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make decisions without explicit programming. It involves training models using large datasets to recognize patterns, classify information, and make predictions. ML is widely used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, e-commerce, and autonomous systems.</p>
        <p class="course-description">The core concepts of machine learning include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. In supervised learning, models are trained on labeled data, whereas unsupervised learning identifies patterns in unlabeled data. Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, involves training an agent to make decisions through trial and error, commonly used in robotics and gaming.</p>
        <p class="course-description">Popular ML algorithms include regression, decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and deep learning models. Frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn provide powerful tools for building and deploying ML models. Feature engineering, model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning play a crucial role in improving accuracy and performance.</p>
        <p class="course-description">With the increasing demand for intelligent automation, machine learning is transforming industries by enabling predictive analytics, recommendation systems, and natural language processing. As ML continues to evolve with advancements in deep learning and generative AI, professionals skilled in data science and ML engineering have vast career opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
